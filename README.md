## Getting Started

Responsive Layout: The dashboard will adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations (portrait/landscape) using Flutter's layout widgets and the device_preview package for easy testing on different devices.
Expandable Sections: The left-hand navigation menu will feature expandable sections using the expandable_page_view package, allowing users to easily navigate and access different sections of the dashboard.
Data Visualization: The app will incorporate data visualization using the fl_chart package. This will enable users to visualize their financial data through charts and graphs, providing valuable insights into their spending and income patterns.
Financial Tracking: The app will provide features for tracking income, expenses, and transactions. Users will be able to input and categorize their financial data, and the app will automatically calculate and display relevant statistics and summaries.
User Authentication: The app will include basic user authentication to protect user data and allow for personalized financial tracking.
